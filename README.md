# Leetcode-Solutions

A .NET 8.0 Console Application containing my **C# solutions for LeetCode problems**, neatly organized by topic.  
Each problem is placed in a topic-specific folder and can be run via `Program.cs`.  
The structure is designed for clarity, easy navigation, and quick testing inside Rider or Visual Studio.

---

## üì¶ What it does

- Stores **topic-based solutions**:
    - Arrays & Hashing
    - Dynamic Programming (1D & 2D)
    - Graphs & Advanced Graphs
    - Backtracking, Greedy, Tries, etc.
- Each folder contains problem solutions named:  
  `ProblemName - Leetcode <Number>.cs`
- `Program.cs` acts as the entry point for testing
- `.gitignore` ensures clean version control (ignores `bin/`, `obj/`, IDE files)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

From the project root:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run

To test a specific problem:
	‚Ä¢	Open Program.cs
	‚Ä¢	Call the class and method of the solution you want to run:

var solver = new Solution1();
var result = solver.TwoSum(new[] {2,7,11,15}, 9);
Console.WriteLine($"[{string.Join(", ", result)}]");

üß™ Tests

‚ö†Ô∏è No unit tests yet, but the project supports adding them.
Future plan:
	‚Ä¢	Add Leetcode-Solutions.Tests/
	‚Ä¢	Use xUnit for problem-level testing
	‚Ä¢	Automate test runs with GitHub Actions

‚∏ª

üí° Notes
	‚Ä¢	Solutions follow clean C# conventions and structured namespaces
	‚Ä¢	Repository organized for interview prep and long-term practice
	‚Ä¢	Can be extended with multi-language support (e.g., Python) if needed
